## Project description and context.

The project aims to explore the possibility of integrating 
energy storage faciltities within the shipping industry marcket. 
In this application we simulate one possible solution on how to
synchronize fuel based gensets with a battery storage system
alonge side with energy optimization to reduce energy cost throughout the trip journey. The whole project is build based on an optimization mathimatical model and uses MILP (mixed intiger linrear programing) methodes to solve optimaly the problem.  

In the Notebook scripts associated with this porject, we simulate an application used to optimize fuel consumption for vessels using one genset to produce the required energy and one battery storage system to store and realese the excess of that energy when needed in a hybrid mode.

The framwork used in this case study is PuLP, to solve a Mixed Intger Linear Programming problem together with first the built-in solver CBC and then with a commercial solver, we used Gurobi in our case.
