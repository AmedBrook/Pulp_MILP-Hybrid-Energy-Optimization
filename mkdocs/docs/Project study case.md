Project study case.
====================

This particular case is initially specefic for the offshore shipping industry as they are the most transportation fuel consuming and needing some sort of solutions to use fuel optimally in their trips. However this is not only exlusive to this sector, it can be easily extended to other sectors as long as the purpose is to optimize energy
usage and energy hybridization using only one genset and one battery storage system (1Gen-1bat for short).
